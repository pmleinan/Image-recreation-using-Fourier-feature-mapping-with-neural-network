This project is made to try to explain and explore th method of using Fourier feature mapping in combination with neural networks. 

Only requirement of the code is the need of a input file. Either in a standard file format like .jpg og .png. or in a the FITS file format. 
No example images are provided with this code. 

Both images type can be loaded at the same time, but the system can only train on one image at the time. You have to choose which file format to pass in the code. 

This code is made on the basis of this work https://bmild.github.io/fourfeat/. It has been modefied to fit the purpus of our task.
